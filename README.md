### Project 2: Earthquake Data Analysis and Visualization

-----------------------------------------
## Data Sources: 

[Food.com Recipes and Interactions](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
   "The dataset is pulled from GeoJson, updated by USGS on a daily basis."

Note: Please refer to source URL for Food.com original CSVs.

-----------------------------------------
## Objective:

The main focus of the project is to exhibit visualization of the data analysis; data pulled from GeoJson, using back-end Javascript hosted by Flaskapp Python script.

-----------------------------------------
## Analysis Conclusion:

The data analysis concludes the frequency of earthquake occurences over the period of time, which can be scrolled left to right to view historical changes. Each magnitude of the earthquake can also be depicted by enlarging and shrinking range of circle. In such cases where posting data analysis in decimal data, subject type of Javascript visualization can assist in better understanding of the statistical conclusions.
